## Practice

Seminar [colab url](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/nlp_course/blob/2020/week02_classification/seminar.ipynb)

Your task for this week is to get past two notebooks: `./homework_part1.ipynb` and... you guessed it, `./homework_part2.ipynb`. 

The second part of homework requires you to train a deep neural network. See `./seminar.ipynb` for problem description, tips and tricks.
